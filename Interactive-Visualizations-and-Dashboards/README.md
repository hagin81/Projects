# Interactive Visualization and Dashboards 

In this project, I built an API using Flask ( Python ) with SQLite as the datastore. This API is then called via Javascript using Plotly.js and an interactive visualization and dashboard is created out of the data. 

Bootstrap was used as the HTML framework
